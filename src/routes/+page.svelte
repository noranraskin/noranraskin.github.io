		<!-- Hello, and welcome to my personal website! My name is Noran, and I am a student and software
        developer based in Berlin, Germany. Currently, I am studying embedded systems and working as a
        software developer, primarily focusing on backend software and speech synthesis. In addition to my
        professional work, I have a strong interest in smart home and IoT projects, which I work on in my
        free time. I enjoy exploring new technologies and developing my skills in various programming
        languages, including Go, Python, C, and Swift. On this website, you'll find information about my
        background, skills, and experience as a software developer. I also have a blog section where I
        document my hobby projects and share my thoughts on the latest trends and developments in the tech
        industry. If you're interested in learning more about my work or want to get in touch with me,
        please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you find it
        informative and engaging! -->
